Simple Pixel Game Engine

This is the template which I use often in order to create some projects during GameJam events like LudumDare. This template is really useful if you are skilled using C++ because it allows us to display quickly a prototype on screen. It has been inspired by an amazing tool which is named OLC PixelGameEngine (by Javidx9), but I changed many parts to keep only the essential, modifying some functions and features. At end, this template is different, keeping the first spirit - maybe less sophisticated, but simple enough to control everything. As a first example, you can find in the Examples folder a MineSweeper game (I will add progressively other games or app). Have fun ++
