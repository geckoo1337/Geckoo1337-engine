Simple Pixel Game Engine

This is the template which I use often in order to create some projects during GameJam events like LudumDare. This template is really useful if you are skilled using C++ because it allows us to quickly display a prototype on screen. It has been inspired by an amazing tool which is named OLC PixelGameEngine (by Javidx9), but I changed many parts to keep only the essential, modifying some functions and features. In the end, this template is different, keeping the first spirit - maybe less sophisticated, but simple enough to control everything. As a first example, you can find in the Examples folder a MineSweeper game (I will progressively add other games or app). Have fun ++

If you need more features, take a look at its big brother - the OLC PixelGameEngine at the link below :
