Simple Pixel Game Engine

This is the template which I use often in order to create some projects during GameJam events like LudumDare. This template is really useful if you are skilled using C++ because it allows us to quickly display a prototype on screen. It has been inspired by an amazing tool which is named OLC PixelGameEngine (by Javidx9), but I changed many parts to keep only the essential, modifying some functions, adding features like a custom font, a randomizer, some algorithm to compute (non regular) polygons creation and more more more. In the end, this template is different, keeping the first spirit - maybe less sophisticated, but simple enough to control everything. Have fun ++

As first examples, you can find some projects like :

A MineSweeper game with its logical gameplay (it uses the custom font and colors),

The traditionnal Conway's Game Of Life,

A simple widget giving time (using the windows time system),

A collecting game which manages the pixel's alpha and a custom particle system,

An application displaying the full colors' spectrum...
